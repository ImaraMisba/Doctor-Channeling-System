# Doctor-Channeling-System
A Java console application for managing doctor appointments and clinic operations

The doctor channeling system is a command-line Java application developed to facilitate fundamental clinic management operations. The system enables users to register patients and doctors, search for doctors by specialization, schedule and cancel appointments and efficiently manage waiting lists. It employs straightforward, menu-based interactions to facilitate user convenience while illustrating structured programming principles. Core clinic data is organized using data structures like ArrayList, LinkedList, Queue and stacks, which help keep information stored in an orderly way, manage appointments effectively and track the recent registered patients. The application provides a methodologically valid and practical model in the management of clinic operations.
